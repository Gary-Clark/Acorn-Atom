This adapter can be glued under a BBC Type 2 angled keyswitch then this can be plugged into the holes of a sabrecoil keyswitch with the wires soldered to the keyswitch then run up the channels and soldered to the PCB.
The stalks of the adapter should then be melted and squashed to lock the adapter in position.

I have used this to replace the spacebar sabrecoil keyswitch which is easily cut away from the frame, to release a sabrecoil and a key mount to fit in a damaged position.
